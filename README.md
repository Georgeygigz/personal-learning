## Relational Model
### Base on mathematics
#### Set Theory
#### First-Order Predicate Logic
### Relationships between elements based on datavalues(PrimaryKey)
### Rules for relational databases describe behavior
#### Information rule
- Information can only be stored as values in the table
#### Guaranteed Access Rule
- Every value must be access using combination of table name column na,me and the values of primary key card
#### Systematic treatment of null values
- States how missing values should be handled
#### View Updating rule
#### High Level insert, Update, and Delete

## Development of Storage hardware
### Punch cards
### Punch Tape
### Magnetic Tape
### Spinning Disk
 
## Data Modeling
- how many table do we need
- what columns go to each table 
-  and how that relate

### Conceptual data modeling
- Mainly intended to assess and formalize all the information that is relevant for the model
### Physical
- eXACT IMPLEMNTATION OF THE logical data model optimized for specific implementation
### Logical
- Defines how tha business information should be stored in the database in the schema that is designed for specific design technology
